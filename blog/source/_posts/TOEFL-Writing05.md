The cane toad is a large amphibian species *native to(原产于)* Central and South American.It was *deliberately(故意)* introduced to Austalia in 1935 with the exoectation that it would protect famer's crops by eating harmful insects.Unfortunately,the toad multiplied rapidly,and a large cae toad pupulation now threatens small native animals that are not pets.Several measures have been proposed to stop the spread of the cane toad in Australia.

T:3 ...东西 -> ...事

***3 measure -> stop CT***

例子：3 方式方法/理论/证据/理由 -> ...

One way to prevent the spread of the toad would be to build a national fence.A fence that blocks the advance of the toads will prevent then from moving into those parts of Australia that they have not yet colonized.This approach has been used before: a national fence was erected竖立 in the early part of the twentieth century to prevent the spread of rabbits,another animal species that was introduced in Austalia from abroad and had a harmful impact on its native ecosystems.

T:

***1. fence 栅栏 (block advance - X move X colonized --FE -兔 - from 外 - X ecosystems)***

Second,the toads could be captured and destruyed by volunteers.Cane toads can easily be caught in simple traps and can even ve caouryed by hand.Young toads and  cane toad egs are ecen easier to gather and destroy,since they are even easier to gather and destroy,since they are restricted to the water,If the Australian government were to organize a camoaign among /austalian civilitan.

***2. volunteers (easily caught - traps/hands - easier young/eggs - 水 - if govertment - campaign -stop)***

Third,reaschers are developing a disease-causing cirus to control the cane toad populations.This cirus will be specially designed:although it will be able to indect a number of reptile and amphibian species,it will not harm nost of the indected species;it will specifically harm only the cane toads,The cirus will contrul the pupulation of cane toads by

In the past century,the steady frowth of the human pepulation and the *corresponding对应的* increase in agriculture and pesticide use have cused much harm to wildife in the United States ,birds in particular,Unfortunately for birds,these trends are likely to continue,with the result that the number of birds in the United States will necessarily decline.

***T:3 populations/agri/pesticide -> brids decline***

First,as human pupulation and settlements continue to expand,birds's natural will continue to disappear.froests,wetlands ,and grasslands will give wat to ever more homes,mails and offices.As the traditional area suitable for birds keep decreasing,so will the size of the bird populations that depend on those *vansihing消失的* habitats.

***T: populations(expand - x natural forest/wet/grass - area - habits)***

Second,agricultural activeities must increase to *keep pace with与...同步* the growin human population.The growth of agriculture will also result in the further destruction population.The growth of agriculture will also result in the further destruction of bitd habitats as more and more wild erness area are convered to agricultural use.As a result,bird population in rural areas will continue to decline.

***T: agriculture (growth - population - wilderness->agri -)***

Thrid,as human settlemenys ecpand and agticulture increase the use of chemical peticieds will also increase.Pesticieds are poisons designed to kill agriculture and home gared pests,such as insects but inecitably, pesticides get ito the water ad into the food chain for birds where they can harm birds.Birds that eat the posioned insects or drink contaminated water can die as a result,and ecen if pesticides do not kill bitds outright,they can prevent them form reproducing successfully ,So pesticeds hace significantly contributed to declines in vitd pupulation ,and ecause ther will continue to ben a need to control agriculture pests in the future this decline will continues.

***T:pesticide (pest die - posion in chain - water/food - harm birds - bitds declines)***

Like many creatures, humpback whales migrates long distances for feeding and *mating交配* purposes.How animals manage to migrate long distanvesis often puzzling.In the case of humpback whales,we may have found the answer they may be *navigating导航* by the stars,much as early human sailors did ,What we konw about humpback whales makes this a distnct possibility.

***T: 3 证据 -> navi by star***

First,humpback whales seem to be intelligent enough to use stars to navigate by.Whales's brains have a high degree of complexity -- a common determiner of intelligence.This suggests that the whales'brain pwer far exceeds that of most other animals.The whales well-developed congnitive ability seems to provide a sound basis for the ability to use a complex,abstract system of sensory stimuli such as the night aky for orientation.

***T: intelligent (brain complex - intelligence - brain power > - congnitive ability)***

***T: straight line ()***

***T: spy-hopping ()***
