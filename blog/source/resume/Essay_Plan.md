**Why am I picking this topic?** 

The reason I chose this theme is because I have received many benefits that I did not expect from physical exercise. I started exposure to fitness in high school, and during the next five years I tried different types of fitness, such as street workout, fitness, bodybuilding and gymnastics. In the process of exercising, I have met many friends who exercise together like my teacher, classmates and strangers. At the same time, exercise has also enhanced my health. This makes me more confident, more energetic, better face the job, and most importantly, happier. So I want to spread this concept and make more people happy.
